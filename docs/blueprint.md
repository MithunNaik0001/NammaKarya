# **App Name**: NextGen App

## Core Features:

- Core Functionality: Set up the basic structure of a Next.js application, including routing and page layout.
- UI Components: Implement a set of reusable UI components using a modern component library to achieve the best possible user experience and ensure optimal performance of the components.
- API Integration: Establish the foundations needed to facilitate interaction between frontend and external services or internal backend. The foundations need to support async calls to avoid locking of main process and prioritize error handling
- Code Style Enforcement: Linters and code formatters to ensure maintainability and readability.
- Deployment Configuration: Prepare configuration and deployment process to ensure the app can be deployed and run reliably, using platforms like Vercel.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF) for a bright and modern feel.
- Background color: Light cyan (#E0FFFF) - same hue as the primary, heavily desaturated, to create a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Dodger blue (#1E90FF) - an analogous color slightly to the 'left' of the primary, for highlights and interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Modern, minimalist icons, consistent with the Next.js ecosystem and UI components. To fit in visually with modern UI standards.
- Clean and well-spaced layout to improve readability and the responsiveness needs to follow latest standard practices.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide a polished user experience when transitioning between pages and interactive functionality.
